# SmartChat: A Council of AIs

SmartChat stands as an innovative solution in AI-driven communications, harnessing the advanced capabilities of AI 
models like GPT, CLAUDE, and GEMINI. Enhanced by the Anthropic AI SDK and Google's Generative AI tools, this platform
ensures that inquiries are intelligently routed to the most appropriate AI, guaranteeing not only accuracy but also
contextually relevant responses.

## Key Features

### Diverse AI Integration
Utilizes @anthropic-ai/sdk and @google/generative-ai for dynamic collaboration between AI models, providing nuanced
and comprehensive responses.

### Advanced Security and Authentication
Implements robust security measures with bcrypt for secure hashing and passport with passport-google-oauth20 for
OAuth authentication, ensuring the safeguarding of user data.

### Real-time Data Handling
Leverages axios for efficient, promise-based HTTP requests, facilitating seamless communication with AI APIs for
prompt responses.

### Scalable Infrastructure
Built on a solid foundation with express for the server framework, redis for optimized session storage and caching,
and knex alongside PostgreSQL for robust database management.

SmartChat is a work in progress.
